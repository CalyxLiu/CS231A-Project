## Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image: Model Analysis Across Datasets

Our project contains files for our CS 231A Project, Winter 2022. 

The video demos from qualitative analysis are included in the Video Demos folder.

The scripts used to download and process the RealEstate10K data are included in the Real Estate 10K Scripts folder.

Colabs based on Tucker & Snavely's model (originally from https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/single_view_mpi) that include our additional metrics and dataset sampling are included in the Qualitative MPI Analysis and Quantitative MPI Analysis folders.

Finally, Example Data from Datasets includes a few images from RealEstate10K, a video from RealEstate10K, and a few Impressionist Landscape images.
